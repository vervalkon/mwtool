# mwtool
A file decompressor/dumper for Mario &amp; Wario

## a few things to know
* You _must_ edit the `rompath` and `outpath` variables on rows `6` and  `7` before running the script
* A folder called `OUT` must exist near your ROM. It won't get autogenerated
* Never tested on a non-macOS environment
* Not tested for all edge cases so who knows what kind of problems there might be

## faq
1. how does this even work
   * i don't really remember, i wrote this a long time ago and it's not very verbose. I will edit this when I recall it all
2. why can't you run it straight from the command line with arguments and options and all that jazz?
   * i don't know how to program that
3. how to recompress?
   * see above
4. which file is which?
   * see ROMMAP.txt
